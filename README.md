# Headmouse
An opensource project developed in UTN-FRBA by Ramiro Fontalva

This project is part of a larger one called "Tecnoapoyos y Sociedad", which aims to level the opportunities of access to technologies for those who are impaired by some kind of disability, motor or neurological.

In order to use HeadMouse, you will need to install opencv, dlib and pynput, you should also download "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" and add it to your folder, given that this file is far too big to be uploaded to the repo.

I am looking for constructive criticism and suggestions to improve this project and make it the best tool it can be to help those with disabilities, so please write me at ramirofontalva@gmail.com if you have any comment about it.

Thank you!
